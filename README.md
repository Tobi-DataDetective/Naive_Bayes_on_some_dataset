# NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFICATION
This contains mini-research on Naive Bayes Classification, its inspired by the combined knowledge of Udacity and Simplilearn. It comprises of all my work in process and Journey to understanding the naive bayes algorithm perfectly. Udacity’s “Introduction to Machine Learning” and also Simplilearn's "Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm" provides a comprehensive study of the algorithms.

This research includes the types of Naive Bayes Classifiers:
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Multinomial Naive Bayes
* Bernoulli Naive Bayes

### Naive Bayes
Let's start with a basic introduction to the Bayes theorem, named after Thomas Bayes from the 1700s. The Naive Bayes classifier works on the principle of conditional probability, as given by the Bayes theorem.
Bayes theorem calculates the conditional probability of the occurrence of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

### What is Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes is a machine learning method you can use to predict the likelihood that an event will occur given evidence that's present in your data

### Gaussian Naive Bayes
Used in classification and assumes features follows normal distribution.

### Multinomial Naive Bayes
Used for discrete counts. Example is for text classification problems, counts how many times a word occurs in a sentence.

### Bernoulli Naive Bayes
Used when your feature vectors are binary.

### Language and Package
This research is using Python3. The packages are used in this project including Numpy, Panda, random, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn, seaborn.

Note: This is not a fully reported work, as interpretations aren't done. The main purpose of this is just to understand how the code flows and the work proceedure for carrying out any Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.
